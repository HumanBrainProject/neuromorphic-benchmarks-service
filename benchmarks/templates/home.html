<p>Benchmarking of neuromorphic hardware puts numbers on performance to allow measuring progress
and comparing different designs.
This is useful both for the developers of the Neuromorphic Computing Platform and for potential users.</p>

<p>Specifically, benchmarks define a set of reference tasks aiming at a direct comparison of different neuromorphic
(and non-neuromorphic) hardware systems.</p>

<p>Each task runs a simulation of a neuronal network model, records data from the neurons,
performs analysis of the data, and calculates numerical measures of the system performance.</p>

<p>This website tracks these performance measures, enabling the comparison of performance
across systems and over time.</p>
